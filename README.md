## Official Laravel Starter Kits

Below are the list of the [Official Laravel Starter Kits](https://laravel.com/starter-kits). These can be installed via the CLI without the need to include the `--using` flag; however, to keep things consistent we'll show the value of the `--using` flag for each starter kit.

### [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit)

```
--using=laravel/react-starter-kit
````

### [Vue Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit)
