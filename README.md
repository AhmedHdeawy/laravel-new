## Official Laravel Starter Kits

Below are the list of the [Official Laravel Starter Kits](https://laravel.com/starter-kits). These can be installed via the CLI without the need to include the `--using` flag; however, to keep things consistent we'll show the value of the `--using` flag for each starter kit.

### [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit)

```
--using=laravel/react-starter-kit
````

### [Vue Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit) 

```
--using=laravel/vue-starter-kit
````

### [Livewire Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/livewire-starter-kit) 

```
--using=laravel/livewire-starter-kit
````

> [!WARNING]
> Because these projects are created by the community, it's very important to be cautious when installing any application. Make sure to do your research and learn more about the project before installing.

#### [Svelte Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/livewire-starter-kit)
